Routes/index.js
controls all the GET pages for the site.

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'My Class' });
});

/* GET welcome page */
router.get('/welcome', function (req,res,next){
  res.render('welcome', {title: 'The Intelligent Web'});
});

the {title: 'Hello World'} are server variables to be rendered.


views/welcome.ejs
are the rendered pages using 'pseudo-html'. its all HTML except for those server variables.

 <h1><%=title%> is a cool module</h1>

so this would talk to the router.get('/welcome') and see title is 'The Intelligent Web'




	<h1>Welcome to <%= title %></h1>
    	<p>Please Click <a href="/welcome">getting the other file</a></p>

this is in index.ejs so it would talk to router.get('/') and see title is My Class
the a href works as any href HTML tag and takes to the routes folder
